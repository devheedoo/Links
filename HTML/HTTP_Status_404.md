### Notes from: 404 Not Found - HTTP | MDN

`404 Not found` client error response code indicates that **a server can not find the requested resource**.

Many web sites customize the look of a 404 page to be more helpful to the user and to provide guidance. To make those pages useful for web site users, see [a set of best practices](http://alistapart.com/article/perfect404).

### Notes from: The Perfect 404 - An A List Apart Article

The most common reasons that people find themselves on a 404 page:

- a mis-typed URL (or an out-of-date bookmark/favourite)
- a search-engine link that is out-of-date
- an internal broken link that the webmaster hasn't noticed

#### Don't point the finger

Don't admonish the user. Use the phrases, "might have" and "possibly".

#### 404 Must-haves

- A link to the site map (if you have one) and the home page.
- A search box, if you have a site search box.
- A distinctly minimalist look.
